<h1>Time Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>The phrase 'Time complexity' is used to express how the runtime of an algorithm changes with input size. An efficient algorithm will have a lower time complexity.</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory or space required by an algorithm to run to completion. Common notations include O(n), which indicates linear space complexity.</p>
